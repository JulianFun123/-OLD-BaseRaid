WARNING: This Plugin is not finshed and buggy. It's very old. Also the codingstyle is not good.
It's just for sharing the Idea.

I have used Maven, but it's not initialized.

The server wont work!
1. Put a spigot.jar into the server directory
2. Put a Multiverse in the plugins directory
3. Start the server via the `start.sh`
4. Before joining type `mv load gameworld` and enter it
5. Have fun playing!
